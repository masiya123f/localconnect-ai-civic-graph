LOCAL GRAPH – CIVIC INTELLIGENCE LAYER

🚀 WELCOME

Welcome to the Local Graph repository – the open-source foundation for Africa's first real-time civic intelligence layer.

This project transforms anonymized commercial activity into predictive insights for urban infrastructure management. We're building in the open because civic technology requires civic trust.
